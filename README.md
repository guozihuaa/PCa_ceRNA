# Systematic evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic significance of competitive endogenous RNA networks in prostate cancer
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks act as essential mechanisms in tumor initiation and progression, but their diagnostic and prognostic significance in prostate cancer (PCa) remain poorly understood. Presently, using the RNA expression data derived from multiple independent PCa-related studies, we constructed a high confidence and PCa-specific core ceRNA network by employing three lncRNA-gene inference approaches and key node filter strategies and then established a logistic model and risk score formula to evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic values, respectively.
